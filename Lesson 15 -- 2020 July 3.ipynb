    "This is a bit harder, but worth trying a bit: The pickle module lets you turn data structures into bytestrings, and back. That’s normally used for storing data on disk and then retrieving it later. You take a data structure and turn it into a bytestring with pickle.dumps, which returns a bytestring. You can then take a bytestring and turn it back into data with pickle.loads. Create a dict in which the keys are strings and the values are ints, strings, and lists (not too many). Use pickle.dumps to turn it into a bytestring. Then turn it back into a data structure… are they the same?"
